ASSIGNMENT 7
The USB keyboard driver is manipulated to change the CAPSLOCK functionality through NUMSLOCK.

There are two modes: MODE1 and MODE2
When we insert the driver the functions are explained below:
MODE 1: The CAPSLOCK has the usual behavior. CAPSLOCK led is turned on and off and it works normally.

Now, while changing to Mode-2 CAPSLOCK will be off. 

MODE-2: When NUMSLOCK is pressed, CAPSLOCK will automatically be turned on. The driver will be in this mode until NUMLOCK is pressed again.
And the CAPSLOCK behavior can be observed to be opposite.
The words will be typed in lowercase and when you press the CAPSLOCK again(Led goes off) it will type in uppercase.
